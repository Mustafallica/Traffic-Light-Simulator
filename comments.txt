1) First step is parent reads the file containing traffic information using fillDataFromFile().In fillDataFromFile() function we check for whether file exists or not.If exits we read data.It is assumed that in file line greater than 2 will hold cars information.We fill this information in car information array that is a structure that holds cars license plate, time, direction info.

2) Second step is parent orders the car movement according to clockwise direction for that we have written rearangeCarInfo() function.We begin with initial direction that was supplied in input file and according to that we arrange cars in clock wise manner like if initial direction is 'N' then next car will be from 'E' than next will be from 'S' than next will be from 'W' .....For this purpose we are using a circular clockwise map that tells which direction will be next in clock wise manner.

3) Third step is parent creates child processes using fork function and waits using wait(null) function till its childern finishes their execution.Each child process displays its information and sleep for number of seconds it takes to cross intersection then it exits using exit(0) function and Then next child come and displays its information.this procedure repeats till all children displays their information. and then parent exits.
